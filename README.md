Things I learned:
How to apply *Promises* to manage multiple asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
I implemented *Chain Promises* to handle sequential data retrieval and manage dependencies between API calls.
Utilize .catch() and .finally() to handle errors and perform cleanup tasks in a *Promise Chain*.
Designed custom error classes to improve error identification and debugging.
Implemented a retry mechanism to manage failed asynchronous requests, enhancing application resilience.
I used error handling strategies in asynchronous workflows.
